# Firebase Setup and User Management Guide

## ðŸ”¥ Step 1: Clean Up Existing Firebase Authentication

### Delete Existing Users from Firebase Console:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Authentication** > **Users** tab
4. Select all existing users and click **Delete User**
5. Confirm deletion

This ensures a fresh start where all users will be properly stored in Firestore.

## ðŸ”¥ Step 2: Set Up Firestore Database

### Enable Firestore:
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database**
3. Choose **Start in test mode** (we'll add security rules later)
4. Select your preferred location
5. Click **Done**

### Apply Security Rules:
1. Go to **Firestore Database** > **Rules** tab
2. Copy the rules from `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md`
3. Replace existing rules and click **Publish**

## ðŸ”¥ Step 3: Test the Updated Application

### Test User Registration:
```bash
# Run the app
flutter run
```

1. **Sign Up Process:**
   - Create a new account with email/password
   - Verify that user data is stored in Firestore `/users` collection
   - Check that email verification works

2. **Sign In Process:**
   - Sign in with the new account
   - Verify user data loads correctly
   - Check profile information

3. **Blog Creation:**
   - Create a draft blog post
   - Publish a blog post
   - Verify data is stored in `/blogs` collection

## ðŸ”¥ Step 4: Verify Database Structure

### Check Firestore Collections:
1. Go to **Firestore Database** > **Data** tab
2. Verify these collections exist:
   - `users` - Contains user profiles with all fields
   - `blogs` - Contains blog posts (when created)
   - `comments` - Will be created when comments are added

### Sample User Document Structure:
```json
{
  "uid": "user_id_here",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "unique_username",
  "name": "User Full Name",
  "photoURL": null,
  "bio": null,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "lastLoginAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "followersCount": 0,
  "followingCount": 0,
  "postsCount": 0,
  "interests": [],
  "isVerified": false,
  "profileViews": 0,
  "totalLikesReceived": 0,
  "totalBlogViews": 0
}
```
